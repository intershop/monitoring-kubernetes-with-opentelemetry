# Monitoring Kubernetes with Open Telemetry

This repository is dedicated to provide a quick start to monitor you Kubernetes cluster. It is designed to be as scalable as possible with the further functionality of exporting necessary telemetry data to multiple New Relic accounts. If want to know where the repo is headed, check out the [issues](https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/monitoring-kubernetes-with-opentelemetry/issues) and the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/newrelic-experimental/projects/12/views/1)!

## Prerequisites

The Helm chart uses Open Telemetry collector Custom Resource Definition (CRD) which requires the [Open Telemetry operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator) to be deployed. In order to deploy the operator refer to this [Helm chart](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/opentelemetry-operator) or simply use the [`00_deploy_operator.sh`](./helm/scripts/00_deploy_operator.sh).

## Getting started

How does this repository monitor your Kubernetes cluster? What does it supposed to deploy and why? What should be configured and how? All the answers you need, are to be found [here](./helm/README.md)!

Obviously, sending all the telemetry data to New Relic alone doesn't make any sense. It is crucial to comprehend how the data is collected and what attributes are refering to what exactly. That's why, there is a pre-built monitoring stack waiting for you [here](./monitoring/README.md) which you can easily deploy per Terraform!
